\pagenumbering{arabic}

\section{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for an online calculator application. The calculator will be used by students and teachers within Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS) to perform complex mathematical calculations. This SRS covers all aspects of the calculator application, including user interface, functionality, performance, and security.


\section{Document Conventions}
\subsection*{Font Conventions}
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Bold: Used to highlight keywords and important terms.
    \item Italics: Used to emphasize specific points or to introduce new concepts.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Requirement Prioritization}
Requirements are prioritized using a three-tier system: High, Medium, and Low.
Lower-level requirements are assumed to inherit the priority of their parent requirements unless explicitly specified otherwise.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This SRS is intended for the following audiences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developers: To understand the functional and non-functional requirements of the calculator application.
    \item Project Managers: To track project progress and manage resources.
    \item Testers: To develop test cases and conduct testing activities.
    \item System Administrators: To deploy and maintain the calculator application.
\end{itemize}
To understand the overall scope and objectives of the project, it is recommended to read the "Overall Description" (Section~\ref{sec:overall}) section first. Then, readers can focus on the specific sections that are relevant to their roles and responsibilities.

\section{Project Scope}

The online calculator application will provide students and teachers with a powerful tool to perform complex mathematical calculations. The system will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Authenticate users using the school's existing authorization system.
    \item Provide a user-friendly interface for basic and advanced mathematical functions.
    \item Allow users to save and retrieve their calculations.
    \item Ensure the security and privacy of user data.
    \item Be accessible from various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
\end{itemize}
By providing these features, the calculator will enhance the learning experience for students and improve the efficiency of teaching and research activities.

\section{Product Perspective}
The online calculator is a web-based application designed to provide students and teachers with a powerful tool for performing complex mathematical calculations. It integrates with the school's existing authorization system \cite{hufs} to ensure secure access. The calculator will be deployed on the school's server infrastructure and accessed through web browsers. The following is the context diagram of the system.

\section{Product Functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    \item Advanced Mathematical Functions: Trigonometry, logarithms, exponential functions, and calculus functions. Â  
    \item User Authentication: Authenticate users using the school's authorization system.
    \item User Authorization: Control access to the calculator based on user roles and permissions.
    \item Data Storage: Allow users to save and retrieve their calculations.
\end{itemize}
The following is a dataflow diagram indicating a top-level view of the overall system functions. (You may also use a usecase diagram here)
